Welcome to the Snake Game project! This is a classic arcade-style game where the player controls a snake to collect food, grow longer, and avoid collisions with walls or itself.

## 🚀 Features
- **Smooth Controls**: Move the snake using `w`, `a`, `s`, `d` keys.
- **Dynamic Gameplay**: The snake moves continuously in the chosen direction.
- **Score Tracking**: Keep track of your high score.
- **Simple Interface**: Minimalist design for distraction-free gameplay.
